CS166 is a Minerva Schools @ KGI course on Modeling, Simulation, and Decision Making taught by professor Carl Scheffler.

I apply advanced decision techniques such as real options, Monte Carlo simulation, network concepts from graph theory, probability theory and statistical physics to analyze and predict the behavior of social, economic and transportation networks. Examples include project portfolio management, pharmaceutical drug development, oil and gas investment decisions as well as philanthropic portfolio decisions requiring high-stake tradeoffs in highly uncertain environments.
